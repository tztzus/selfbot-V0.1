Important: Please be aware that using selfbots is against Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service. A selfbot is a bot that runs on a user account rather than a bot account, and automating actions on your user account (such as sending messages, reacting, or interacting with the platform in any way through a script or bot) violates Discord's ToS.

By using or distributing this selfbot, you assume full responsibility for any consequences, including account termination or other penalties that may result from violating Discord's rules. We strongly discourage the use of selfbots and recommend using bot accounts to ensure compliance with Discord‚Äôs guidelines.

Remember: Always use bots responsibly and follow the rules set by Discord to ensure the safety and integrity of your account.
